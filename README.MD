Current Dump for progress in Google IT Automation
=====================

Here, is mostly where I would dump files into here. Not necessarily the **best** documentation but a proper documentation is **WIP**. This include :
- Basic of Python e.g Syntax and Semantic
- Python Interaction with Operating System
- Basic Troubleshooting Concept
- Final Assignment for the specialization
- Some other stuffs as well

Should be updated as soon as I can.
